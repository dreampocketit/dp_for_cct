1. if we divide the power into 2 parts by time, one of them might have higher accuracy than all data. So, about EEG, the time factors should be considered. 

2. With 2-3 seconds baseline, we could get higher precision rate from 120 data. So, it's confirmed that EEG would change its basedine states by time. 

3. Should we ding for 2 seconds?

4. normalize data with ln would decrease 10-15% percision rate 

5. with baseline change data
  k-front-precision: svm  >  ann (0-10%)
  k-end  -precision: svm  =  ann (sometimes svm higher than ann, sometimes not)
  k-all  -precision: svm  =  ann (almost the same, the difference between 3%)
  J-all  -precision: svm  =  ann (0-6%)

6. average precision of Katrina is 55%, but Jennifer is 60%
